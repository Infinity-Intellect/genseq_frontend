Automated Gene Sequencing Application

Title of the Project: GenSeq - Automated Gene Sequencing

Description:
To detect the presence of COVID-19 with 100% accuracy sequencing of genome is the only option. Though RT-PCR and antibody test are available they are costlier and time consuming techniques. The major problem to be encountered in sequencing is obtaining sequence from the gel because of its poor resolution also it requires X-ray image of gel obtained from autoradiography. In order to overcome this problem we have developed a web based app solution which reads the sequence directly from the gel under the UV light

Hardware and Software Requirements:
Hardware Requirements: Any computing device such as a phone or a laptop, preferably a laptop.
Software Requirements: Any web browser such as chrome or firefox.

Process Flow:
1. The user selects the order of the bases as per the input image, on our webiste.
2. The user then uploads the image to our website.
3. On submitting the image, the user gets a response indicating the gene sequence of the corresponding image given.
